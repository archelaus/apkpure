This is a Python script that allows you to retrieve basic information about an Android app from APKPure, a popular online repository for APK files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library
- [Cloudscraper](https://pypi.org/project/cloudscraper/) library

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 cloudscraper
```

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it from the command line, providing the name of the app you want to search for as a command-line argument:

```
apkpure "App Name"
```

If you don't provide the app name as a command-line argument, the script will prompt you to enter it interactively.

The script will then use APKPure's search results to find the first app link related to the specified app name. Once it finds the link, it fetches the information about the app, such as the app name, package name, download URL, version, and developer.

## Output

The script will display the app information in the following format:

```
App Name: [App Name]
Package Name: [Package Name]
Download URL: [Download URL]
Version: [Version]
Developer: [Developer]
```

If the script encounters any errors during the process, it will display relevant error messages.
